        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: 
            I hope this semester can do my best to achieve the best grades I can do.
            I want to learn simple dynamic effects such as JavaScript or other programming with dynamic effects that have simple visual effects and look and feel but can present cool effects.</p>
          <p></p>
        </p>
        <p>Inspiring site: <a href=http://www.manuel-rueda.com/ ></a></p>
        <p></p>
        The highlight of this website is the eye-catching visual scrolling design. This design uses a visual rolling difference design to show the designer's various video works one by one. Users can directly scroll the mouse to view different excellent video works one by one, such as watching a movie, which is full of charm and fantastic visual effects.
        <p>Learning point: Use visual scrolling design to highlight page products, layout, and hierarchical structure</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project how will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I plan to design a European style tour in the first project, showing five unique small towns in different countries or scenic tourist attractions. Mainly introduce some European landscapes and features that have become more popular in recent years, and bring a visual feast for people who have recently been isolated at home.</p>
        <p>I want to use wide-screen large-size photos to show the charm of each scenery as much as possible. Moreover, the view introduced in each place is of a completely different style and climate, such as the ocean, castle, snow-capped mountains, grassland, etc., which give people a different experience and multiple choices.</p>
        <p>For the website's theme and tone, I want to choose beautiful and bright colors to echo the colorful landscape photos, drive the audience's joyful emotions, and let people be attracted by this website while watching.</p>

        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose.

Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: From my perspective, the people attracted to my website should be people who like to travel and love the scenery. They may long for freedom and want to explore the beauty of the world. They want to explore different places or go to a beautiful place to relax and let go of their worries. Of course, I also belong to these descriptions, and these are also my wonderful expectations for this topic.</p>      </section>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response:<ul>
                      <li>1. Accept me bravely, face my problems, and don't avoid them. Exposing shortcomings can help us grow better and correct issues. Obvious defects are also easier to make progress. The lower the start, the faster the progress.</li>
                      <li>2. In the more unfamiliar learning situations, I should speak enthusiastically because no one knows me and expects too much. A stress-free environment will reduce the constraints on learning ability and keep moving forward.</li>
                      <li>3. Try to accept me, make myself more comfortable, don't dwell on my own mistakes, take everything, and learn with a better attitude.</li>
                      <li>4. Don't think of learning as a tiring task or work, forcing myself to do it. Instead, look at it from a different perspective and treat it as a lifelong mission to make myself better.</li>
                      <li>5. Don't be led by emotions but try to learn to control emotions. According to the emotional strength of depression and resistance, be prepared to suppress this emotion or accept and vent it.</li>
                      <li>6. Don't blindly stay in the comfort zone of destructive emotions and be dominated by our feelings. Instead,  let us jump out, used brainpower and spirit to fight and counterattack, and used strong willpower to defeat this bad mood and make the heart stronger!</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.
        </p>
        <p>Response:I chose Ding Tea milk tea shop as the theme of my business website. I chose milk tea because many of my friends are deeply addicted to drinking milk tea. They even think milk tea is their blood! In summer, I need to drink a glass of iced milk tea from Ding Tea in PSU almost every day. When I drank the first sip, I felt satisfied in this hot summer. And I have tried many milk tea shops in Portland. I think Ding Tea is my favorite milk tea brand that suits my taste the most. I think this store's location is also very convenient, it is located on the campus, and most of the customers are students.</p>
        <p>Because I found the brand’s original website did not only target the Portland area, nor did it have enough store and product information, such as seasonal, limited editions, new featured products or discount events, etc., I want to design a section that contains more comprehensive information on the milk tea shop website. I want to add more specific information and content of the local store to the newly designed website.</p>
        <p>I have looked at several other milk tea websites and found that they all use big titles and eye-catching red to attract people's attention. Red is the color that promotes people's senses and consumption. The website also contains a lot of large-size pictures and dazzling colors. But the content of these web pages is vibrant, which contains a lot of production videos and bright colors, which makes people full of vitality. One of the shortcomings is that the design of these websites sometimes makes people lose their grasp of the point.</p>
        <p>Therefore, on the website I design, I may avoid this. I will use low-key colors to match the colorful hues of milk tea to highlight the brand's high-level sense as a whole. I will make the website design simple, clear, and intuitive, highlighting each part's theme.</p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read this article on mobile first design and share your thoughts on mobile first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p>Response:I think this article is fascinating and has enhanced my professional knowledge about mobile electronic product design. I have been exposed to this phenomenon in my life before. For example, the mobile phone interface cannot adapt to the web page's size, and the experience is very uncomfortable. But many of the interface designs that are compatible with mobile phones look more exquisite. Now I understand a particular web design method, Responsive Web Design, to adopt mobile.</p>
        <p>The concept of Progressive Advancement & Graceful Degradation is also exciting, and the theory makes sense. With the rapid development of mobile devices using, people's inevitable frequency and dependence are also increasing. Many peripheral products and commercial chains have gradually been derived with mobiles' development, such as various mobile phone accessories, mobile phone software development, and mobile payment methods for external consumption. When people are designing web pages, it is natural that they are spending more and more effort into their mobiles' web interface.</p>   
        <p>In my daily life, I also found that more and more brand websites and companies are doing better in designing mobile phone interfaces, such as some travel websites that sell tickets and hotels. It is very convenient, and there are few large-scale advertisements to attract attention, like web pages on computers. People can focus on entering the steps that the software wants to operate.</p>
        <p>Statistics about people using desktop and mobile devices to log in to the Internet are interesting and surprising. Two data lines that look almost entirely symmetrical show the speed of changes in the times. I want to move mobile phones and portable pads in the future. It will occupy people's lives more and more, but it will not replace computers' functions.</p>

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What is your "why"? Read article and answer this question.</p>
        <p>Response:This is a great point of view to dig out the most profound reason you do something or set your own goals. As I read through the article, I couldn't help thinking in my heart what was the fundamental reason behind the significant decision or ideal I made. What sustains me to keep going and realize it. When I pushed through the layers of motives and kept trying to ask myself, I finally found the root cause and the more essential, the most important cause for me.</p>
        <p>This way of thinking can be seen as reverse thinking, thinking back from the results. This way of thinking helps us exercise brain power and logical thinking and helps us explore a thing more thoroughly.</p>
        <p>Learning design has been my ideal since I was a child. When I was in elementary school, my dream was to be a designer, and I am also glad that I can choose my future direction now. Before getting into design, I didn't have a thorough understanding of this field. I felt that I looked at design very shallowly, and I might not know why I like it. But as I learned more and more about the design industry, I feel that it is not just a liking but a liking for me. I find that the world of art is getting more and more enjoyable. When I acquire new expertise that I have never known before, I feel that my soul is fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I often ask myself why, but I haven't explored it in-depth, but now I have learned to ask myself a few more questions and keep asking until the end, to give myself the essential motivation. In fact, many times, our goals or what we want to try to change is based on our fears or weaknesses. Sometimes when we need to face the cause, this makes us have to escape. But when we face ourselves squarely, as mentioned in the article we read before, accept our shortcomings and mistakes, and meet them calmly; maybe we will do better. So, when we can resolutely go back to pursue this goal or the origin of the idea and bravely face the most real reasons, it may strengthen our will and make us more courageous to meet and achieve this goal. Because this is the essence, we most want to change, which will affect the origin of all aspects of our lives. Only by changing the fundamentals can we take a step forward.</p>
